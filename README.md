# ðŸš€ Friendly Web Interface for Machine Leaning Project Project with Gradio and and Streamlit ðŸš€

There are many ways to make web interfaces to allow interaction with Machine Learning models and we will cover one of them.

In order to adjust the models to predict the feelings stated in a Tweet (e.g., neutral, positive, or negative), I fine-tuned pre-trained Deep Learning models from HuggingFace on a new dataset for this project.

The sentiment analysis will be analyzed with the aid of this BERT program. Understanding the mood underlying social media messages has become essential in today's fast-paced digital environment, when ideas and emotions are communicated in bite-sized bursts. Enter the world of sentiment analysis, where we use cutting-edge HuggingFace models and deep learning to uncover the mysteries held inside the huge sea of tweets and status updates.


# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant global impact, affecting economies, civilizations, and the lives of people all over the world. The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations has been a significant initiative to solve this epidemic. These vaccines have proven to be remarkably successful at reducing fatalities and serious illnesses. However, false information and divisive discussions about their security, effectiveness, and fair distribution have also surfaced.

## Project Description

I'll use pre-trained models from Huggingface to carry out a sentiment analysis of tweets about the COVID-19 vaccine. These models may be customized for different natural language processing (NLP) applications, including sentiment analysis, and have undergone training on huge volumes of text data. I'll use these pre-trained algorithms to classify tweets into favorable, negative, or neutral feelings by compiling a dataset of tweets about COVID-19 vaccinations.

## Tools, software systems, and libraries needed for the project Setup

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone git clone https://huggingface.co/eric2013/covid



2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis-app
  


  
3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt




4. Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run sentimentapp.py



Open your web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:7865 to access the app.
